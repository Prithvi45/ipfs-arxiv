# IPFS-Arxiv
IPFS-Arxiv is hosted via the interplanetary file system protocol. It is a decentralized collection of the newest 1000 machine learning papers from arxiv. Since the site isn't dynamic, I have to manually upload the new papers every now and then. We will see how long I can keep this up ;)

<b>Siraj - IPFS challenge<b>
<br/>
I have created this site because of two reasons, my primary goal was to create something for IPFS because I think it is amazing and may very well be the future of the internet. And the second reason why I created this particular project at this time is Sirajes IPFS challenge. So Siraj, this is my official submission. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA2rHlbB5i0)
